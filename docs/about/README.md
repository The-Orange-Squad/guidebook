# About The Orange Squad

The Orange Squad is a community of like-minded individuals who are here to learn, grow, and have fun together. We value respect, kindness, and inclusivity, and we strive to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. Our community is built on the principles of collaboration, support, and friendship, and we are always looking for new members to join us on our journey.

## Our Mission

Well, we don't really have a mission statement, but if we did, it would probably be something like this:

"To create a positive and inclusive community where everyone feels welcome, valued, and supported. To foster a culture of respect, kindness, and collaboration, and to provide a safe and welcoming space for all members to learn, grow, and have fun together." (AI-generated mission statement, don't sue us)

## Our Values

We value respect, kindness, and inclusivity in all of our interactions, actual and virtual. Everyone is welcome in our community, regardless of background, experience, or skill level. We believe that diversity is a strength and that everyone has something valuable to contribute. We are committed to creating a safe and welcoming environment for all members, and we expect everyone to treat each other with respect and consideration. 

## Our Community

Fellow members of The Orange Squad come from all over the world and somehow manage to get along despite the time zone differences. We have a diverse group of individuals with a wide range of interests, skills, and backgrounds, but we all share a common goal: to learn, grow, and have fun together. Our community is a place where you can ask questions, share ideas, and connect with others, who are willing to do ANYTHING together. We are here to support each other, learn from each other, and have a good time together.

## Our Vision

No one really knows what the future holds, but we like to think that our community will continue to grow and evolve. We hope to create new opportunities for people to connect to each other, no matter who one is or where one comes from. We want to make a positive impact on the world and inspire others to do the same. We believe that by working together, we can achieve great things and make the world a better place for everyone.
