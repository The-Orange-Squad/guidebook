# Sensitive People

The Orange Squad welcomes people from all walks of life, and we work hard to create a safe and supportive environment for everyone. We understand that some people may have unique needs or challenges, and we are committed to accommodating those needs to the best of our ability.

If you are a sensitive person who struggles with social anxiety, mental health issues, or other challenges, please know that you are not alone. Many members of our community have similar experiences and can offer support and understanding.

## SafeChat

SafeChat is a special AI-based bot that censors offensive language and provides trigger warnings for sensitive topics. This bot is designed to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of their background or experiences. Do, however, note that swearing is not prohibited, but it is recommended to keep it low.

If you have any concerns or questions about SafeChat or need additional support, please reach out to a moderator or admin. We are here to help and want to make sure that everyone feels comfortable and respected in the community.
