# Server Legends

Sometimes, LyubomirT will give you a role called "Server Legend". This is a special role that is given to members who have made significant contributions to the community. Server Legends are recognized for their hard work, dedication, and positive impact on the community.

The actual criteria for becoming a Server Legend are a closely guarded secret, known only to LyubomirT. However, some common ways to earn this prestigious title include:

- **Active Participation**: Contributing to discussions, projects, and events in a meaningful way.
- **Helping Others**: Providing support, guidance, and assistance to other members of the community.
- **Positive Attitude**: Maintaining a positive and welcoming attitude in all interactions.
- **Creativity**: Bringing new ideas, projects, and initiatives to the community.

If you are lucky enough to be named a Server Legend, wear your title with pride! You are an important part of the community, and your contributions are greatly appreciated.

Server Legends are given special privileges and access to exclusive channels and events. They are also recognized in the community as leaders and role models. If you see a Server Legend in the community, be sure to thank them for all they do to make The Orange Squad a great place to be.

If you have any questions about the Server Legends program or how to become a Server Legend, feel free to ask LyubomirT or another member of the community. We are always happy to help and support each other on our journey to greatness.
