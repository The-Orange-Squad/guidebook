# Why Do We Always Ban and Not Kick?

At The Orange Squad, we have a strict policy of banning members who violate our rules or cause problems in the community. This may seem harsh, but we have good reasons for taking this approach.

## Consistency

By banning members who break the rules, we maintain consistency in our enforcement of community guidelines. This sends a clear message that certain behaviors are not tolerated and helps to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. Also, we want to make sure that nobody returns to the server with an alt account, as bans are IP-based.

## Protection

Banning members who engage in harmful or disruptive behavior helps to protect the community as a whole. We take the safety and well-being of our members seriously and will not hesitate to remove individuals who pose a threat to the community.

## Accountability

Banning members who violate our rules holds them accountable for their actions. It sends a message that there are consequences for inappropriate behavior and helps to deter others from engaging in similar conduct.
