# Worst Case Scenario (LyubomirT's Guide)

## Introduction

Welcome to the worst-case scenario guide! In this guide, we will explore some of the worst things that can happen in the community and how to handle them. While we hope that these scenarios never come to pass, it's important to be prepared for any eventuality.

## The Worst-Case Scenarios

### 1. Raid

A raid is when a large group of users from another community floods our server with spam, hate speech, or other disruptive content. Raids can be damaging to the community and can disrupt normal activities.

Moderators should act quickly to ban raiders and remove any offensive content. They should also consider implementing additional security measures to prevent future raids or temporarily restricting access to the server.

### 2. Doxxing

Doxxing is the act of publicly revealing someone's personal information, such as their address, phone number, or social security number. Doxxing is a serious violation of privacy and can have severe consequences for the victim.

If someone is doxxed in the community, moderators should take immediate action to remove the information and ban the offender. They should also provide support to the victim and take steps to prevent further doxxing incidents.

### 3. LyubomirT Goes Rogue

LOL, I might sometimes go haywire and do something stupid, but I promise I won't do anything that will harm the community. If you see me acting weird, just ping me and I'll try to fix it.

### 4. Server Outage

If the server goes down, don't panic! It's probably just a temporary issue that will be resolved soon. You can check the status of the server on our website or Discord server for updates.

### 5. Internal Conflict

Sometimes, moderators disagree on how to handle a situation or members have a falling out. In these cases, it's best to either leave it to the moderators to resolve or bring it to the attention of the community for discussion.

Life's tough, I know. I do have them sometimes, but I'm trying to get better. There is a low, very low chance that I will jump from that bridge, but I promise I won't do it anytime soon.
