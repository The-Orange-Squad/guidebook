## How it all began

The story of The Orange Squad begins in the winter of 2023 when Lyubomir Ternavskiy (Lyubomir / Lyu) decided to create a Discord server for his friends, since the old one was getting a bit too dead. The server was initially intended to be a place where Lyubomir and his friends could code together, share memes, and have fun. Little did he know that this small server would grow into something much bigger and more meaningful.

The first name was "Lyubomir's Squad" but it was quickly changed to "The Orange Squad" because of the orange color of the server and the shield with two crossed swords in the middle. The shield was created by Lyubomir himself and it became the symbol of the server.

## The Orange Squad is born

The Orange Squad was officially born on February, 27th, 2023, when Lyubomir created the Discord server and invited his friends to join. The server started with just a handful of members, but it quickly grew as more people joined and invited their friends to join as well. The first members of The Orange Squad were Lyubomir, Yaromir Ternavskiy (Yaromir / Yaro), TGkun (Jade / TheDiamondEye), Pix (Pixelated_Pickaxe), and a few others.

## First steps

In the early days of The Orange Squad, the server was a small and close-knit community of friends who wanted to connect and collaborate with each other. The members of the server were mostly programmers, artists, and gamers who shared a common interest in technology and creativity. They spent their time chatting, sharing memes, and working on projects together.

## Growing pains

As The Orange Squad grew in size and popularity, it faced some challenges along the way. The server had to deal with issues such as spam, trolls, and toxic behavior from some members. The only one in charge of moderation at the time was Lyubomir, who had to juggle his responsibilities as the server owner with his other commitments. Despite these challenges, The Orange Squad continued to grow and thrive as a community. However, it became clear that more help was needed to keep the server running smoothly. That's when the first moderators were assigned to help with moderation tasks.

## Original content

One of the things that set The Orange Squad apart from other Discord servers was its focus on original content. The members of the server were encouraged to create and share their own work, whether it was art, music, code, or anything else. Lyubomir created a few bots like Orange Bank and MindMeister AI to help with the server's economy and entertainment. The server also had (and still has) a dedicated channel for sharing your own creations, where members could showcase their work and get feedback from others (name share-and-rate checks out).

## From a squad to a community

While the server was initially a server for programmers and gamers, more and more people from different backgrounds and interests started joining. The server became a diverse community of individuals with a wide range of skills, interests, and backgrounds. The members of The Orange Squad came from all over the world and somehow managed to get along despite the time zone differences. The server became a place where people could connect, collaborate, and have fun together, regardless of their background or experience.

## Challenges and triumphs

You can't imagine how happy we were when we reached 100 members. It was a huge milestone for us, Lyu even got a mental breakdown because of the happiness. The server continued to grow and evolve, and we faced new challenges along the way. We had to deal with issues such as server attacks, spam, and toxic behavior from some members. However, we also had many triumphs, such as hosting successful events, reaching new milestones, and creating a positive and inclusive community. Some of the most memorable moments include but are not limited to:

- The first server event, which was a game night where members played Among Us together.
- Chess League, where members competed in a chess tournament to see who was the best chess player in the server.
- The release of AIDA, the server's AI assistant, which was created by Lyubomir to help with moderation tasks and provide information to members. (Sadly, MindMeister AI was shut down because of the lack of interest and the fact that it was a bit too complicated for the average user. Also, the models were too big and expensive to run.)
- The creation of the Guidebook, which was a collaborative effort by the members of the server to create a living document that outlined the rules, guidelines, and culture of the server.

## The Ant incident

I HATE THIS GUY!! There was a particular member on the server who constantly caused trouble and was a nuisance to everyone. This member, who we will refer to as "Ant" (not his real name), was known for his toxic behavior, demeanor issues, and general lack of respect for others. Despite multiple warnings and attempts to reason with him, Ant continued to cause problems and disrupt the server. Eventually, after a series of incidents and a full-blown raid on the server, Ant was permanently banned from The Orange Squad. The server is much better off without him, but that incident taught us a valuable lesson about the importance of moderation and enforcing the rules.

## What we have now

Today, The Orange Squad is a thriving community of over over 300 members from all over the world. The server has grown and evolved over the years, but it has remained true to its core values of respect, kindness, and inclusivity. The server is a place where people can connect, collaborate, and have fun together, regardless of their background or experience. We have a diverse group of individuals with a wide range of interests, skills, and backgrounds, but we all share a common goal: to learn, grow, and have fun together.

## The future of The Orange Squad

Currently, we have the following plans for the future of The Orange Squad:

- Hosting more events and activities for members to participate in.
- Release ReForm and more games for the server.
- Expanding the Guidebook and creating more resources for members.
- Reaching 1000 members by the end of 2025 (to be honest, we are not sure if this is possible, but we will try our best).
- Creating a positive and inclusive community where everyone feels welcome, valued, and supported.
