## Moderation Guidelines

### General Guidelines

1. **Respect and Professionalism**: Moderators must treat all members with respect and maintain a professional demeanor.

2. **Neutrality**: Base all decisions on server rules, not personal opinions or relationships.

3. **Transparency**: Be open and communicative about moderation actions when appropriate.

4. **Confidentiality**: Do not share private or sensitive information about members.

5. **Promptness**: Address issues and reports promptly and efficiently.

6. **Communication**: Maintain good communication with fellow moderators and the server owner.

The full list of rules and guidelines can be found in the [Moderation Guidelines](moderation-guidelines.md) document.

### Moderation Process

First, moderators will take a look at the reported message or issue and assess the situation. They will then try and come up with a good solution that is fair and just. Moderators, afterward, are supposed to talk to the user (if possible) and explain the situation to them. If the user is not cooperative, the moderators will take further action. Although some cases are just plain obvious and do not require any further explanation other than - "You broke the rules, here is your punishment."

### Moderation Actions

Moderation actions can range from a simple warning to a permanent ban. Specifically, this is what you can expect:

- **Warning**: A verbal warning to the user. Only given for minor offenses.
- **Timeout**: A temporary mute, with the duration depending on the severity of the offense.
- **Ban**: A permanent ban from the server. Only given for severe or repeated offenses.
- **Automated Kick**: If not verified within 90 minutes, the user will be kicked from the server.

## Reporting

Orange SafeChat has a `/report` command normal users may use to report messages or users. Moderators will then take a look at the report and assess the situation. If the report is valid, the moderators will take appropriate action.

If you have any questions or concerns about moderation, please feel free to reach out to a member of the moderation team.
