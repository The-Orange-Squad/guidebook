# Birthdays

The assistant can remember birthdays for you. You can ask the assistant to remember a birthday for a contact, and it will remind you when the birthday is coming up. It can also remind you of upcoming birthdays for the current month.

## How to Set Your Birthday

To set your birthday, use the `/set_birthday` command followed by your birthday. Luckily, there are Autocompletes available, so you can simply type the first letters of the month name and the assistant will try to show you the rest of the word. For example, to set your birthday to the 1st of January, you would use `/set_birthday January 1`.

## How to Clear Your Birthday

If you want to clear your birthday from the assistant's memory, you can use the `/clear_birthday` command. This will remove your birthday from the assistant's database. Useful when you want to change your birthday or if you no longer want the assistant to remember it, since you can't just run `/set_birthday` again to change it (without clearing it first).

## How to View Your Birthday

To view your birthday, you can use the `/show_birthday` command. This will display your birthday as it is stored in the assistant's database.

## How to update your birthday

First, you need to clear your birthday using the `/clear_birthday` command. Then, you can set your birthday again using the `/set_birthday` command. If you're feeling silly, ask a mod to do it for you.

## How to View Upcoming Birthdays

To view the upcoming birthdays for the current month, you can use the `/soon_birthday` command. This will display a list of all the birthdays that are coming up in the current month. You can also customize the number of days to look ahead by providing a number as an argument to the command. For example, `/soon_birthday 7` will show the birthdays for the next 7 days.

Oh, any by the way, happy birthday! ðŸŽ‰
