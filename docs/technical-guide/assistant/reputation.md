# Reputation in Orange Assistant

Reputation is a special status that you can earn by being active on the server and helping other users. You can earn reputation points by participating in events, helping others, or just being a good member of the community. However, you can also lose reputation points if you break the rules or engage in negative behavior.

## How to Earn Reputation Points

### What to do:

- **Be active**: Participate in events, chat with others, and help out where you can.
- **Be helpful**: Answer questions, provide support, and be a positive influence on the server.
- **Be respectful**: Treat others with kindness and respect, and follow the rules of the server.

### What not to do:

- **Be inactive**: If you're not active on the server, you won't earn reputation points.
- **Break the rules**: Engaging in negative behavior, spamming, or being disrespectful can result in losing reputation points.
- **Cause drama**: Starting arguments, being rude, or causing trouble can also result in losing reputation points.

## Reputation points from chatting

You passively earn reputation points by chatting in the server. The more you chat, the more reputation points you earn. However, there is a cooldown between each reputation point you earn. You can check how many messages are left till the next reputation point by using the `/nextrep` command.

## Risk of ban

If your reputation drops below 20%, you will most likely be banned from the server. This is to ensure that the server remains a positive and welcoming place for all members. If you have any questions or concerns about your reputation status, please contact Lyu or any other Co-owner for assistance.

## How to check your reputation

You can check your reputation points at any time by using the `/rep view` command. This will display the number of reputation points you have earned and your current reputation level. If you have any questions about your reputation status, please contact Lyu or any other Co-owner for assistance.

## How to reward someone with reputation points

If you think someone deserves recognition for their contributions to the server, you can reward them with reputation points using the `/rep add` command. This will add reputation points to their total and help them reach the next reputation level. Please use this command responsibly and only reward users who have earned it. Alternatively, you can right-click their message, select "Apps", and click "Give Reputation".

## How to remove reputation points

If you believe someone has received reputation points unfairly or has engaged in negative behavior, you can remove reputation points from them using the `/rep remove` command. This will deduct reputation points from their total and help maintain a fair and positive reputation system on the server. Please use this command responsibly and only remove reputation points when necessary. Alternatively, you can right-click their message, select "Apps", and click "Remove Reputation".

## Upvote/Downvote system

Soon enough, we will introduce an upvote/downvote system where you can upvote or downvote messages to reward or penalize users for their contributions. This will provide a more interactive and engaging way to earn reputation points and recognize the efforts of others. Stay tuned for more information on this exciting new feature!
