# Ping Statuses

Orange Assistant lets you set a custom status message that shows up when you are pinged. This can be useful for letting others know what you're up to or if you're available to chat. To set your custom status, use the `/setstatus` command followed by your message. Note that it must be something appropriate and not too long, moderators are able to remove inappropriate statuses.


## How to Set Your Status

Simply use the `/setstatus` command followed by your message. For example, to set your status to "I'm busy right now", you would use `/setstatus I'm busy right now`.

## How to Clear Your Status

When you no longer want to display a status message, you can clear it by using the `/clearstatus` command. This will remove your status message and revert to the default behavior.

## How to View Someone's Status

Well, you can either ping them or use the `/status` command followed by their username. This will display their current status message. The latter is more useful if you want to check someone's status without actually waking them up.

## How to View Your Status

Ping yourself? Just kidding, you can use the `/status` command followed by your username to view your current status message.

## What is considered inappropriate?

Inappropriate statuses basically include anything that is against the rules of the server. This includes but is not limited to: NSFW content, hate speech, personal attacks, etc. Moderators have the right to remove any inappropriate statuses and take further action if necessary.
