# Orange Assistant To-Do

Orange Assistant has a built-in to-do list feature that allows you to create and manage tasks right in Discord. The bot includes pretty much all the features you'd expect from a to-do list app, such as adding, removing, and completing tasks, setting due dates and reminders, and more. This guide will walk you through how to use the to-do list feature in Orange Assistant.

## How to Use the To-Do List

To get started with the to-do list feature, you'll need to use the `/todo init` command. This command initializes the to-do list for your account, basically creating a new to-do list for you to use. Once you've initialized the to-do list, you can start adding tasks to it.

### Adding Tasks

To add a task to your to-do list, use the `/todo add` command followed by the task name and description. Note that the name can't be longer than 100 characters, and the description is limited to 1000.

### Viewing Your To-Do List

To view your to-do list, use the `/todo list` command. This will display all the tasks in your to-do list along with their IDs, names, and descriptions.

### Completing Tasks

To mark a task as completed, use the `/todo complete` command followed by the task ID. This will mark the task as completed and remove it from your to-do list.

### Editing Tasks

To edit a task in your to-do list, use the `/todo edit` command followed by the task ID and the new task name and description. This will update the task with the new information.

### Removing Tasks

To remove a task from your to-do list, use the `/todo remove` command followed by the task ID. This will remove the task from your to-do list.

This is different from completing a task, as removing a task will delete it entirely from your to-do list.

### Moving Tasks

To move a task to a different position in your to-do list, use the `/todo move` command followed by the task ID and the new position. This will move the task to the specified position in your to-do list.

### Clearing Your To-Do List

This is a destructive command and also a quick way to get rid of everything at once. To clear all tasks from your to-do list, use the `/todo clear` command. This will remove all tasks from your to-do list.
