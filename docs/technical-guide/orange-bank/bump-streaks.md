# Bump Streaks

Bump Streaks are a way to earn coins by bumping the server on [Disboard](https://disboard.org/). You can earn up to 500 coins per bump, depending on your streak. Each bump increases your streak by 1, and the streak resets to 0 if someone else bumps the server before you.

## How to bump the server

1. Go to the #server-bump channel in the BOT USAGE category.
2. Type `/bump` in the channel.
3. If there is a cooldown or the bot is down, you will receive a message telling you to try again later. Return to step 2 when the cooldown is over or the bot is back online.
4. If the bump is successful, you will receive a message telling you that you have successfully bumped the server. Your streak will increase by 1, and you will receive coins based on your streak.

## How much can I earn?

The amount of coins you earn per bump depends on your streak. The formula to calculate the amount of coins you earn is `random(100, 500) * streak`. For example, if your streak is 5, you can earn between 500 and 2500 coins per bump.

## How to check your streak

Currently, there is no way to check your streak in the bot. However, you can check your streak by looking at the #server-bump channel. Each streak-ed bump has a message that tells you (or the person who bumped) how many times they have bumped the server in a row.

## How to increase your streak

The only way to increase your streak is to bump the server. If someone else bumps the server before you, your streak will reset to 0. Make sure to bump the server as soon as the cooldown is over to keep your streak going.

## Is this feature available in other servers?

No, this feature is exclusive to Orange Bank. If you want to earn coins by bumping the server, you will have to do it in Orange Bank. However, you can still earn coins by participating in the server, grinding, investing, and more. Check out the [Ways to earn money](ways-to-earn-money.md) file for more information on how to earn coins in Orange Bank.

## Is there a cooldown for bumping the server?

Yes, there is a cooldown for bumping the server. The cooldown is currently set to 2 hours. If you try to bump the server before the cooldown is over, you will receive a message telling you to try again later. Make sure to bump the server as soon as the cooldown is over to keep your streak going.
