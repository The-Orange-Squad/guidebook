The two bots share some similarities, but Orange Bank has more features and is more actively maintained.

## How do I get a Deposit Token?

The most straightforward way to get a Deposit Token is to buy it from the shop for 10 million coins. You can also find it randomly while mining (0.07% chance) or by finding it in a Gift Box (0.5% chance). Deposit Tokens are a great way to increase your earnings in Orange Bank, so it's worth the investment.

Either from events, or by buying them with coins. They are quite expensive, but they are worth it. You can use them to generate content at AIDA Web App, which can be quite fun and rewarding.

Additionally, you receive AIDA Tokens for Boosting or for being a BMC supporter.
