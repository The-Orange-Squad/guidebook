## Choosing a Company

When choosing a company to invest in, you should consider the following factors:

- **Company Performance**: Look at the company's stock price, its growth over time, and its market share. Companies with a history of growth are more likely to continue growing in the future.

- **Other Investors**: Check the company profile to see who else is investing in it. If other investors are confident in the company, it's a good sign that it's a safe investment. Although, don't just blindly follow the crowd.

- **Your Wallet**: Make sure you have enough coins to invest in a company. Don't invest all your coins in one company, diversify your investments to reduce risk.
