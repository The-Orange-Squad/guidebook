# Orange Bank Referral System

The referral system in Orange Bank allows users to earn coins by referring new users to the server. When a user joins the server using a referral link, the referrer receives a reward based on the new user's activity, just as the new user receives a reward for joining.

The referral system is a great way to grow the server and earn coins at the same time. This guide will explain how the referral system works and how you can use it to your advantage.

## How to Refer a User

To refer a user to the server, you need to create an invite link first. Simply click the server name and select "Invite People". You can then copy the link and share it with your friends or post it on social media.

Then, you need to activate the referral link using the `/referral launch` command. This will turn your invite link into a referral link, allowing you to earn coins for each new user that joins using that link. 

## Checking Your Referrals

You can check how many people you have referred to the server using the `/referral check` command. This will show you a list of all the users that have joined using your referral link, along with the rewards you have earned from each user.

## Disconnecting a Referral Link

If you no longer want to use a referral link, you can disconnect it using the `/referral disconnect` command. This will remove the link from the referral system and prevent you from earning any more rewards from it. Or, you can just delete the invite link, although this is a bit less graceful.

## Moderators and Referrals

Moderators have the ability to disconnect a user's referral link using the `/referral mod_disconnect` command. This can be useful if a user is abusing the referral system or if their link is no longer valid.
