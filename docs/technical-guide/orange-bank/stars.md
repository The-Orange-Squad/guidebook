# Stars in Orange Bank

Stars are a special currency (but basically just an item) that can be used to put messages in the spotlight, or essentially "pin" them in a special channel. You can earn stars by participating in events, or by buying them with coins. Stars can be used to pin messages in the `#starboard` channel, which is visible to everyone in the server.

To pin a message, right-click it and select "Apps > Star Message". The message will be pinned in the `#starboard` channel for everyone to see. Do note that it's not possible to unpin a message once it's been pinned, so make sure you're pinning the right message! And, one more thing, manual stars cost 1 star.

## Automatic Stars

So, you know there is an upvote emoji in the server, right? Well, if you react to a message with that emoji, and 5 other people do the same, the message will be automatically pinned in the `#starboard` channel. This is a great way to show appreciation for a message without having to spend any stars. This is exactly why many messages from #share-and-rate (where an automatic upvote reaction is added) are pinned in the `#starboard` channel.

## Soon: Starboard Ping

Soon enough, members will be able to select a special role to be pinged whenever a message is pinned in the `#starboard` channel. This will allow members to stay up-to-date with the latest pinned messages and not miss any important things.

## Soon: Starboard Rewards

After the Starboard Ping feature is released, members will be able to earn rewards for having their messages pinned in the `#starboard` channel. The rewards will be based on the number of upvotes the message receives, and will be given out automatically by the bot.

### Important Note

Only **AUTOMATIC** stars count for rewards. Manual stars are just a way to show appreciation for a message, and don't have any other benefits. So, if you want to earn rewards, make sure to upvote messages with the upvote emoji!
