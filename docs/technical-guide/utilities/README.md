# Orange Utilities

There honestly isn't much to tell about the Orange Utilities bot. It's a simple bot that provides a few utilities for the server and performs some basic background tasks, such as updating the server's member count and managing VIP roles. The bot is mainly used for administrative purposes and doesn't have many user-facing features.

## The only commands:

- `/system_info` - Displays information about the server's system status, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and uptime.
- `/server_health` - Checks the server's health status and displays any issues that need attention. Primarily used by LyubomirT as of now.
